---------------------
Can always validate whether you have the inverse, with:

matrixA * matrixAInverse = MatrixIdentity

---------------------
Assuming x is as above, and you have set the inverse, then:

x$get() %*% x$getInverse()

should yield the identity matrix.

------------------------
Assuming you know that the purpose of assignment 2 is less about the functionality and more about the process of using Git & GitHub, then I assume you want to know whether solve will give you rounding errors: The simple answer is: Yes
In my test the rounding error was only of the order of 10^-17.
For example:

> id <- x$get() %*% x$getInverse()
> id
       [,1]  [,2] [,3]
[1,]  1e+00 7e-18    0
[2,]  2e-17 1e+00    0
[3,] -7e-18 0e+00    1

> round(id, 2)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0
[3,]    0    0    1

------------------------
> diag(x = 1, 3, 3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0
[3,]    0    0    1
